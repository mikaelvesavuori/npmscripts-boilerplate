Too tough for conventional build tools? Use NPM scripts to ES6'ify, Sassify and lint your code, run watch processes, do Jest testing, and do some prepublishing niceties for when you want to go public with your own project on NPM.

## Status
Still unstable. It's a more NPM-specific variety of my previous [Gulp 3 Boilerplate](https://github.com/mikaelvesavuori/gulp3-boilerplate).

## Why would you want to use this?
You want the latest craze in lightweight build tooling without sacrificing any real functionality. You are comfortable with the terseness of putting CLI commands in a package.json. You probably dry your hair with a CPU fan and can't be bothered with fancy config files.

## How do I use it?
Check `package.json` for all of the commands. Start by running `npm run dev` or `yarn run dev` to do Sass, HTML and JS magic with your files.
